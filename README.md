# Cloudflare Free Tier Guide Series

**The Complete Guide to Building Production Applications on Cloudflare's Free Tier**

A comprehensive technical documentation series that teaches developers how to build production-ready applications entirely within Cloudflare's generous free tier limits. From simple static hosting to advanced AI-powered applications with vector search and RAG systems.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

This guide series progressively builds your understanding of Cloudflare's edge computing platform:

- **Foundation**: Static hosting with unlimited bandwidth using Pages
- **Serverless**: Edge functions with Workers (100K requests/day free)
- **Data Layer**: SQLite databases at the edge with D1
- **Caching**: Key-value storage for sessions and optimization with KV
- **Storage**: Object storage with zero egress fees using R2
- **Intelligence**: Vector databases for semantic search with Vectorize
- **AI**: Large language models and image generation with Workers AI
- **Production**: Complete RAG systems and multi-service architectures

## 🎯 Who This Is For

**Perfect for:**
- Developers wanting to minimize infrastructure costs
- Teams building MVPs and prototypes
- Side projects requiring production-grade hosting
- Learning modern edge computing architectures
- Building AI-powered applications on a budget

**Realistic Scale:**
- **2-10K daily active users** (with intelligent caching)
- **Static sites with dynamic APIs**
- **AI-powered applications** (chat, search, recommendations)
- **Complete SaaS applications** (with user management, databases, file storage)

## 💰 Cost Reality

**What's Actually Free:**
- Cloudflare Pages: Unlimited bandwidth, 500 builds/month
- Workers: 100,000 requests/day
- D1: 25 databases, 5GB storage, 25 million row reads/day
- KV: 10GB storage, 100,000 reads/day
- R2: 10GB storage, 1 million Class A operations/month
- Vectorize: 30 million vector dimensions
- Workers AI: 10,000 neurons/day (varies by model)

**When You'll Need to Pay:**
- High-traffic applications (>100K requests/day)
- Large file storage (>10GB)
- Heavy AI usage (>10K neurons/day)
- Advanced features (Access, Stream, Images)
